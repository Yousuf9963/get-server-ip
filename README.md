# get-server-ip

Server IP (Internet Protocol) address is an inseparable part of everything connected on the internet. Its purpose is to make it easy to properly recognize a specific place on the internet where the information is supposed to be sent and received.

 

Before 2011, IPs were following a format of a set of 4 numbers separated by dots. Each number is 1-3 digits long with a value from 0-255. This was called the IPv4 or Internet protocol version 4 format.

 

However, since 2011, we have exhausted the IPv4 and are now using the IPv6 format that looks a bit like this 2600:1005:b062:61e4:74d7:f292:802c:fbfd.

But whatâ€™s important for you, is to know that servers assign specific IP addresses also to websites like yours. Also, depending on your hosting, you can get either a shared or dedicated IP address.
